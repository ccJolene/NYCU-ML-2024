    "### Data\n",
    "Two 100*100 images are provided (image1.png & image2.png), and each pixel in the image should be treated as a data point, which means there are 10000 data points in each image.\n",

    "### Kernel\n",
    "For both kernel k-means and spectral clustering, please use the new kernel defined below\n",
    "to compute the Gram matrix.\n",

    "This new defined kernel is basically multiplying two RBF kernels in order to consider\n",
    "spatial similarity and color similarity at the same time. S(𝑥) is the spatial information (i.e.\n",
